# Map-Maker
This project made use of everything I learned in my first semester of programming.
It generates a map-like grid with different values pertaining to each location.
This project is complete and no longer active.

# Use
UserInterface.java is the file with the main method in it (Run this file).
Unfortunately the paths to assets are absolute paths so they must be changed.

# Picture
Here is an example output of the program!
